# Computer Science Pickup Lines
A congregation of pickup lines from Computer Science majors in Purdue's Class of '24

-----

- Are you CSPickupLines? Because I'm too intimidated to commit to you.
- Are you recursive? Because I’ll do you over and over again.
- I am a pointer to you because my D gets pointy as hell.
- Hey girl, I just reduced this matrix and all I see is a linear dependency between me and you.
- We should be an infinite while loop so we never have to break.
- Are you the main branch? Cause I wanna push a child into you.
- I just row reduced a matrix and all I can see is a dependency between you and me.
- Are you ... because I’d like you to deconstruct me
- Are you https because without you I’m insecure 
- You looking like a recursive function without an exit condition because I never want this to stop
- You must be malloc because I’ve been looking for someone to point me in your direction
- Are you a plus size model because you’re larger than my node modules 
- You must be Unix cause I’m tryna cd into your ~/dms
- You must be asynchronous because I asked you if we could go back to my place later and all I received was a promise and I’m still await-ing your response 
- Damn girl you must be a linked list because I want to traverse your nodes all night
- Dang let’s make like bogo sort and make the night last O(n*n!)
- Are you a stack because I want to start on top and finish on the bottom
